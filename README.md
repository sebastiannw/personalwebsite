# Project 1 - Data Analysis in the Cloud at Scale
My personal website

[Visit here](http://hugoproject-bucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/)

This website is built with Hugo and the [Raditan Free Hugo Theme](https://github.com/radity/raditian-free-hugo-theme).
I created a Cloud9 environment in AWS where I installed Hugo. I created a git repository in Cloud9 which I then pushed
to my GitHub account. Then I forked the theme to my GitHub account so I could edit it and I added it as a submodule in
my Cloud9 environment. I created an S3 bucket on AWS to host the website. Next, I will implement a continuous delivery 
process with AWS.
